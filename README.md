# Urban Tree Environmental Monitoring Platform

---
##  About the Project

The **Urban Tree Ecophysiology** is a web-based application that provides real-time visualization and analysis of environmental sensor data from urban tree monitoring stations. This platform enables researchers, students, and environmental professionals to access, analyze, and download high-quality environmental data.

### Mission
Supporting environmental research and education through accessible, real-time urban tree monitoring data.

### Research Focus
- Urban tree physiology and health monitoring
- Environmental stress indicators
- Climate impact assessment
- Long-term ecological research

## Features

### Data Visualization
- Sensor data from multiple monitoring stations
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Temperature, humidity, pressure, sap flow, and dendrometer measurements

### Multi Node Monitoring
- Monitor multiple tree locations simultaneously
- Easy node selection interface
- Location specific data and metadata
- Status indicators for each monitoring station
